I started this little project weeks ago. Which means I've learned a lot since then. So I've deleted everything I had and replaced it with clean updated code.

I still have to dig into the API so see how to get the data I want, but the call function is working.

Got a very simple GUI up and running. Getting more and more comfortable with connecting interfaces with logic feel good.

I'm intentionally not using React for this because I really want to feel wat it's like to write this stuff from scratch. We'll get there soon. But not yet.

I think I'm going to leave it there for now. It does what I want it to do. I'll create something more involved using React. This was a good practice round :P

Coming back to this project is a trip. I like having it under my belt. It's a good feeling to having something you've done to look back on and re-learn from.

I did some minor updates to the text. I would like to build the UI out a bit at some point. But keep everything vanilla.

I have some features to add. And by "features" I just mean, "I want to show more weather information than just the temp and short description.

Things to include are:

- air quality
- air pressure
- 3 day forecast
- humidity
- percent chance of precipitation
- UV index
- longer weather description

Yeah, that seems a bit more useful.

But more importantly, how is supposed to be actually useful if I can't know which city I'm actually searching? As it is, I can search "Springfield", and I get one result. But there are dozens of Springfields! I'm going to need to improve the search function a lot more, to make this more than a cute toy.
