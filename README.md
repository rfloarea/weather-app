I started this little project weeks ago. Which means I've learned a lot since then. So I've deleted everything I had and replaced it with clean updated code.

I still have to dig into the API so see how to get the data I want, but the call function is working.

Got a very simple GUI up and running. Getting more and more comfortable with connecting interfaces with logic feel good.

I'm intentionally not using React for this because I really want to feel wat it's like to write this stuff from scratch. We'll get there soon. But not yet.
